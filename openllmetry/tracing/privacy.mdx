title: "Privacy"

By default, OpenLLMetry logs prompts, completions, and embeddings to span attributes.
This gives you a clear visibility into how your LLM application is working, and can make it easy to debug and evaluate the quality of the outputs.

However, you may want to disable this logging for privacy reasons, as they may contain highly sensitive data from your users.
You may also simply want to reduce the size of your traces.

To disable logging, set the `TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT` environment variable to `false`:

```bash
TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT=false
```

Traceloop SDK, as well as all individual instrumentations will respect this setting.

## Enabling logging only for specific users

You can decide to selectively enable prompt logging for specific users or workflows.
To do that, first make sure content tracing is disabled globally:

```bash
TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT=false
```

### Using Traceloop

We have an API to enable content tracing for specific users or workflows.
See the [Traceloop API documentation](/api-reference/tracing/whitelist_user) for more information.

### Without Traceloop

Set a key called `override_enable_content_tracing` in the OpenTelemetry context to `True` right before making the LLM call
you want to trace with prompts.
This will create a new context that will instruct instrumentations to log prompts and completions as span attributes.

```python Python
from opentelemetry.context import attach, set_value

attach(set_value("override_enable_content_tracing", True))
```

Make sure to also disable it afterwards:

```python Python
from opentelemetry.context import attach, set_value

attach(set_value("override_enable_content_tracing", False))
```
