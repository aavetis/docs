We've all been there. You followed all the instructions, but you're not seeing any traces. Let's fix this.

## 1. Disable batch sending

Sending traces in batch is useful in production, but can be confusing if you're working locally.
Make sure you've [disabled batch sending](/openllmetry/configuration#disable-batch).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Traceloop.init(disable_batch=True)
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.init({ disableBatch: true });
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Check the logs

When Traceloop initializes, it logs a message to the console, specifying the endpoint that it uses.
If you don't see that, you might not be initializing the SDK properly.

> **Traceloop exporting traces to `https://api.traceloop.com`**

## 3. Try outputting traces to the console

Use the `ConsoleExporter` and check if you see traces in the console.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter

Traceloop.init(exporter=ConsoleExporter())
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
import { ConsoleSpanExporter } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node";

Traceloop.init({ exporter: new ConsoleSpanExporter() });
```

</CodeGroup>

If you see traces in the console, then you probable haven't configured the exporter properly.
Check the [integration guide](/openllmetry/integrations) again, and make sure you're using the right endpoint and API key.

## 4. (Typescript / Javascript only) Did you import the SDK correctly?

If you're using Typescript or Javascript, you must import the SDK before importing any LLM package like OpenAI, Pinecone, and others.
```js
import * as traceloop from "@traceloop/node-server-sdk";

import OpenAI from "openai";
```

## 5. Is your library supported yet?

Checkout [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry#readme) or [OpenLLMetry-JS](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry-js#readme) README files to see which libraries and versions are currently supported.
Contributions are always welcome! If you want to add support for a library, please open a PR.
