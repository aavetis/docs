### Using your prompt

The SDK fetches your prompts from Traceloop servers. Changes made to a prompt are available in the SDK during runtime.
The SDK polls the Traceloop servers for changes every every poll interval.

The default poll interval is 60 seconds but can be configured with the `TRACELOOP_SYNC_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable, or the initialization function.
When in the `Development` environment, the poll interval is determined by the `TRACELOOP_SYNC_DEV_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable or appropriate initialization argument, and defaults to 5 seconds.

To disable polling all together, set the `TRACELOOP_SYNC_ENABLED` environment variable to false (its enabled by default).

You must also configure the SDK with your API Key for a particular environment. See the [SDK documentation](/openllmetry/configuration#api-key) for more information.

<Info>
  The Traceloop SDK will automatically fetch updates you make to your prompts.
  This way, you can deploy your prompt changes without having to redeploy your
  application.

After creating a with the key `joke_generator` in the UI with the following prompt:

```
Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry as a {{persona}}
```

Then, you can retrieve it with in your code using `get_prompt`:

```python
from traceloop.sdk.prompts import get_prompt

prompt_args = get_prompt("joke_generator", persona="pirate")
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(**prompt_args)
```

<Tip>
  The returned variable `prompt_args` is compatible with the API used by the
  foundation models SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) which means you should directly
  plug in the response to the appropriate API call.
