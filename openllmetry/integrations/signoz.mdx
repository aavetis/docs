SigNoz is an [open-source observability platform](https://github.com/signoz/signoz).

### With SigNoz cloud

Since SigNoz natively supports OpenTelemetry, you just need to route the traces to SigNoz's endpoint and set the
ingestion key (note no `https` in the URL):

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="signoz-access-token=<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
```

Where `region` depends on the choice of your SigNoz cloud region:
| Region | Endpoint |
| ------ | -------- |
| US | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
| IN | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
| EU | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |

Validate your configuration by [following these instructions](https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python/#validating-instrumentation-by-checking-for-traces)

### With Self-Hosted version

Once you have an up and running instance of SigNoz, use the following environment variables to export your traces:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4318"
```
