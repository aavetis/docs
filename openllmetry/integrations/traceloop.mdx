Go to [Traceloop Environments Management](https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys)
(you can also reach here by clicking on **Environments** on the left-hand navigation bar).
Click on **Generate API Key**. Click **Copy Key** to copy the API key as it won't be shown again.

Set the API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.
For on-prem deployments, set `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL` to the URL of your Traceloop instance.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
