Since Traceloop is emitting standard OTLP HTTP (standard OpenTelemetry protocol), you can use any OpenTelemetry Collector, which gives you the flexibility
to then connect to any backend you want.
First, [deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#create-an-opentelemetry-collector-optional)
in your cluster.
Then, point the output of the Traceloop SDK to the collector by setting:

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://<opentelemetry-collector-hostname>:4318
```
